        USBSink was a GNOME program for automatic file synchronization with
        removable drives. A user could create file synchronization tasks to
        run whenever an external USB drive would be attached to the computer.
        The program would then watch the subscribed files and directories for
        changes and copy them to or from the removable drive.

        My goal was to create a simple program that would execute one-way file
        synchronization. Once I have reached that goal I have soon lost
        interest in adding more features, even though I listed some further
        plans on the project website. It was basically a student project that
        helped me learn a lot about programming on Linux. I wrote it in C++.
